# Weapon Detection
This project implements a weapon detection system using the YOLOv8 object detection model. The system processes a video file, detects weapons (pistols and rifles), and displays the detected objects with bounding boxes in different colors for different weapon types. Additionally, it saves the processed video with the detections.

# Dataset
The data set was created by labeling gun images.
